<p>Earn Away is a type of affiliate marketing model where affiliates earn a commission not only on the initial sale but also on every subsequent purchase made by the customer they referred. This model can be a powerful incentive for affiliates to promote products and services, as it allows them to earn ongoing commissions over time.

Earn Away works by tracking the purchases made by customers who have been referred by an affiliate. When a customer makes a purchase, the affiliate earns a commission on the sale. However, unlike traditional affiliate marketing models where the commission is only earned on the initial sale, with Earn Away, the affiliate continues to earn commissions on all future purchases made by that customer.

This model is particularly effective for businesses that offer subscription-based services or products with high customer lifetime value. By incentivizing affiliates to refer customers who are likely to make repeat purchases, businesses can drive long-term customer loyalty and increase their revenue.</p>
